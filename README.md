# TreasureDig VR
A VR game I'm making for my senior project using Godot Engine.

## Premise
The idea of the game is inspired by [Treasure Hunting Simulator](https://www.roblox.com/games/1345139196/Treasure-Hunt-Simulator) on Roblox.

The player digs down and is looking for chests that reward with a currency (TBD). The deeper you go, the harder it gets to dig, but the better the rewards are.


## How do i play?
Currently, the game is unavailable. It's not quite in a working state. Once it is, it will be published on Oculus Quest App Labs and a link will be put here.

Keep on eye on the 'App lab' badge to quickly know if the game is on app labs yet.
