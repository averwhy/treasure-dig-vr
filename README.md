# TreasureDig VR
A VR game I'm making for my senior project using Godot Engine.

## Premise
The idea of the game is inspired by [Treasure Hunting Simulator](https://www.roblox.com/games/1345139196/Treasure-Hunt-Simulator) on Roblox.

The player digs down using a shovel and gets paid for each sand block they mine! This is a very early state of the game so there isn't many features.


## How do i play?
In the releases tab is the `.apk` file. You can download this and install it to your headset using Sidequest!

Keep on eye on the 'App lab' badge to quickly know if the game is on app labs yet. It will also be linked in [the releases tab for this repo.](https://github.com/averwhy/treasure-dig-vr/releases)
